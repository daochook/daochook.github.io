[{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/usage/configurations/","title":"Configuring daochook","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Once daochook is fully and properly installed, you are ready to begin configurations.\nBoot Configuration File Format The boot configuration file holds all of the information needed to launch the game client with daochook injected. It also includes some additional configurations used with daochook internally, such as if you wish to enable/disable certain included patches. Please read the following information carefully to ensure your boot configuration file is written correctly.\nSection: [import] (optional) import (string) - The name of another boot configuration file to import. Merges the two files settings\u0026rsquo; together to form a single file. The import section is an optional feature that allows advanced users to create base configuration files that can be used by multiple boot configurations. You can create a single base file that defines the daochook.game, daochook.server and daochook.patches sections then include that into each configuration that will use the same base information. Then your actual boot configuration file only needs to implement the daochook.auth for each character instead.\nSection: [daochook.game] path (string) - The full path to your Dark Age of Camelot installation game.dll file that you wish to launch with daochook. Section: [daochook.server] addr (string) - The server IP address (or DNS name) that you wish to connect to. port (number) - The server port that you wish to connect to. id (number) - The server id that you wish to connect to. (Set to 42 if playing on a private server unless otherwise noted.) Section: [daochook.auth] username (string) - The username of the account you wish to login into. password (string) - The password of the account you wish to login into. character (string, optional) - The name of the character you wish to auto-log into. realm (string, optional) - The realm id of the character you wish to auto-log into. (0 = Albion, 1 = Hibernia, 2 = Midgard) Section: [daochook.patches] disable_encryption (boolean) - Patch that will remove the packet encryption if enabled. disable_multi_instance_check (boolean) - Patch that will remove the multi-client instance check if enabled. override_user_dat (boolean) - Patch that will override the user.dat location to be account-specific. Section: [daochook.addons] This configuration section is special. It does not require the typical key/value pairing and instead, only expects keys. Keys should be the name of addons that you wish to automatically load when the game client starts.\nFor example, this section would look like this:\n1[daochook.addons] 2example 3fps 4move This would automatically load the example, fps and move addon\u0026rsquo;s when the game first starts.\nExample Boot Configuration File Here is a full example configuration file:\n\u0026lt;Path To daochook\u0026gt;\\boot\\config\\atom0s.ini:\n1[daochook.game] 2path= Z:\\Games\\Electronic Arts\\Dark Age of Camelot\\game.dll 3 4[daochook.server] 5addr= 192.168.1.100 6port= 10300 7id= 42 8 9[daochook.auth] 10username= atom0s 11password= password 12character= Atomos 13realm= 2 14 15[daochook.patches] 16disable_encryption = 1 17disable_multi_instance_check = 1 18override_user_dat = 1 Import Usage Example As mentioned above, advanced users can make use of the import section of the configuration file to include a base configuration file that holds information that would otherwise be duplicated across multiple files.

Addons are expected to follow a strict layout / guideline in order to be able to load and function properly! Be sure to read carefully before asking for help.\nCreating A New Addon Addons are located within the \u0026lt;Path To daochook\u0026gt;\\addons\\ directory. Inside of this folder, you will see individual folders for each addon, as well as a libs folder which contains a handful of helper libraries that addons can make use of while running.\nPlease be sure that you understand the following:\nAddons MUST have their own individual folder. Addons MUST have their main .lua script file named the same thing as their folder. For example, if you wanted to make an addon named \u0026lsquo;hello\u0026rsquo;, you would make the following:\n\u0026lt;Path To daochook\u0026gt;\\addons\\hello\\ (The addon folder.) \u0026lt;Path To daochook\u0026gt;\\addons\\hello\\hello.lua (The addons main .lua file.) The name of the folder and main .lua file for each addon is the name that is also used for any of the in-game /addon commands.\nFailure to follow this setup will result in your addon not loading.\nCoding Addons With VSCode Lua is coded in plain-text script files with the .lua extension. There are many code editors that support the Lua language syntax, however we recommend that you use Visual Studio Code. VSCode has multiple extensions that support and extend the Lua syntax. Below is a list of links to the various extensions we recommend you use while developing addons.\nVSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/ sumneko.lua: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua Once installed, you can open the addons folder in VSCode (File -\u0026gt; Open Folder) to have the Lua extension pick up the included predefined information found in the /addons/.vscode/settings.json file. This file holds predefined globals information to help the plugin understand types that are not directly defined in any of the included libs files. (ie. Things exposed by daochook) It is recommended that anytime you are editing an addon, that you open the entire addon folder like this to allow the extension to load these settings. Failure to do so may result in the editor showing errors/warnings on various parts of your code that are otherwise valid.\nCoding Your Addon Once you have your environment setup and established, open your new addon\u0026rsquo;s main .lua script in your preferred editor. (Again, if you are using VSCode, you should open the entire addons folder while editing your addon!)\nAt the top of your file, it is recommended to include a license which states how you wish to share your code. Lua scripts are open source by design, so you will need to understand regardless of what license you pick, anyone that you share the addon with will be able to see its code directly. Feel free to check out the included example addons, libs, etc. for how the license should look. daochook is released under the GNU AGPL v3 license. Other common licenses for open source files are: Apache, BSD, GNU GPL v2, GNU GPL v3, MIT (It is recommended that you read up on each license before picking one and ensuring you understand what it means.)\nNext, your addon MUST implement the expected addon table information. Failure to include this table in your addon will result in your addon not loading.\nThe addon table will look like this:\naddon.name = \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;; addon.author = \u0026#39;atom0s\u0026#39;; addon.desc = \u0026#39;An example addon.\u0026#39;; addon.link = \u0026#39;https://atom0s.com\u0026#39;; addon.version = \u0026#39;1.0\u0026#39;; For more information regarding the predefined addon table, please continue to the next documentation page: Addon Table Information\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/installation/system_requirements/","title":"System Requirements","tags":[],"description":"","content":"daochook Requirements daochook specifically requires the following in order to function:\nMicrosoft Visual C++ Redist. 2022 - https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe Latest Client Requirements Before attempting to use daochook, you should make sure that your system meets the minimum requirements for the official Dark Age of Camelot game client.\nMinimum Recommended Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or equivalent Pentium 4 3.0 GHz or equivalent 512 MB RAM 1 GB RAM 3.5 GB free hard drive space 3.5 GB free hard drive space Compatible 3D acceleration card w/ 64 MB VRAM 256 MB ATI X800 or Nvidia GeForce 6800 series or higher Directx 9.0c or later Direct X 9.0c or later Shader 1.1 or higher Shader 2.X or greater support Internet Connection Required Internet Connection Required There are no additional system requirements in regards to hardware needed for daochook to operate.

See Install via Zip instead.\nCurrently, the best, and recommended, way to install daochook is by using Git. You can either use Git via the command line or install your personal favorite Git client or shell integration. There is no \u0026lsquo;best\u0026rsquo; client or means of using Git, that is entirely personal choice on which you prefer to use.\nSome recommended free solutions are:\nGit For Windows (Direct Git command line access.) - https://git-scm.com/download/win TortoiseGit (Windows shell integration.) - https://tortoisegit.org/ GitHub Desktop (Git GUI client.) - https://desktop.github.com/ Sourcetree (Git GUI client.) - https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ By using Git, it is much easier to keep daochook up to date. You can simply pull the latest changes after you\u0026rsquo;ve initially cloned the release repository.\nPicking An Installation Folder When picking a folder to install daochook to, it is important that you are NOT breaking the following guidelines.\ndaochook should NOT be installed into a system protected folder.\nThis means it should not be put into folders (or folders within) such as:\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\, C:\\Program Files\\, C:\\Windows\\\ndaochook should NOT be installed into the game client folder!\nYou should never install daochook into the game client folder for safety reasons.\nIt should be in its own separate folder entirely!\nA recommended and safe installation location would be something such as:\nC:\\daochook\\ C:\\Users\\Your_Username_Here\\Desktop\\daochook\\ Z:\\Some\\Other\\Folder\\daochook\\ Cloning The Release Repository Please note, because there are so many different Git clients available, it is not possible for us to write a full guide for each one. Instead, this guide will demonstrate how to install using two preselected UI clients and with Git via the command line. The two clients that this guide will use are GitHub Desktop and TortoiseGit.\nInstalling via GitHub Desktop First, download and install the GitHub Desktop client. Once installed, launch it and either sign in with your existing GitHub account, or skip the sign in step. (Note: You do not need to sign in to clone the daochook repository, so you can skip the sign in step if you do not want to or do not wish to create an account with GitHub.) From the top menu, click File then Clone Repository... In the clone window, click the URL tab at the top, then enter the repository URL: https://github.com/daochook/daochook.git For the local path, ensure you follow the guidelines above and place daochook into a valid path. For example, C:\\daochook Click Clone. If everything was successful, you\u0026rsquo;re done and should have daochook now installed to the selected folder!\nInstalling via TortoiseGit First, download and install Git for Windows and TortoiseGit. Follow the various prompts to fully install both tools. Restart your computer. (This is recommended as TortoiseGit is a shell extension.) Navigate to the parent folder where you plan to install daochook to. For example: C:\\ Right-click within the parent folder and choose Git Clone.. (Be sure you are not right-clicking on a folder!) In the clone window, enter the repository URL: https://github.com/daochook/daochook.git For the Directory ensure the path is correct and that it has automatically added \\daochook to your parent folder. Click OK to clone. If everything was successful, a second window should show with some information about the clone and that it was successful. If so, then you\u0026rsquo;re done and should have daochook now installed to the selected folder!\nInstalling via Git Command Line First, download and install Git for Windows. Follow the various prompts to fully install. Open a new command prompt window. (cmd, powershell, Windows terminal, bash, etc. are all suitable for this.) Navigate the command prompt to the parent folder you wish to install daochook to. For example: cd C:\\ Enter the following command: git clone https://github.com/daochook/daochook.git If everything was successful, you\u0026rsquo;re done and should have daochook now installed to the selected folder!\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/usage/running/","title":"Running daochook","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Launching daochook daochook can be launched two different ways. Either by creating a new instance of the game client and injecting into it, or by injecting into an existing game client process. It is recommended that you use daochook by injecting into a new client instance (which the injector will launch for you) for best results.\nWhen the injector starts, it will take the given file name and locate it within the boot configuration directory automatically.\nThe path to the daochook boot configuration directory is: \u0026lt;Path To daochook\u0026gt;\\config\\boot\\\nBe sure to read the configurations documentation page for more information on how to configure daochook.\nNew Process Injection You can launch and inject into a new process via the injector like so:\ndaochook.exe atom0s.ini Existing Process Injection You can inject into an existing process by passing the existing process id as a second parameter to the injector like so:\ndaochook.exe atom0s.ini 1234 Playing On Private Servers daochook is developed and designed mainly for private server usage.

When this happens, the internal addon manager will raise the event in every loaded addon whom has registered one or more callback functions to the event being raised. Addons can register more than one callback to an event if needed.\nAddons are not required to register to any events in order to be considered valid. Events are entirely optional and is best to not register to any event unless you absolutely need information from it. It\u0026rsquo;s a waste of performance to register to events that you are not actually using.\nEvent Functions daochook exposes two main functions for registering and unregistering from events.\n1boolean hook.events.register(event_name, event_alias, callback_func); Parameter Name Type Description event_name string The name of the event to register this callback to. event_alias string The alias for this callback. callback_func function The function to invoke when the event is raised. Returns (boolean) True on success, false otherwise. 1boolean hook.events.unregister(event_name, event_alias); Parameter Name Type Description event_name string The name of the event to unregister the existing callback for. event_alias string The alias for the existing callback to unregister. Returns (boolean) True on success, false otherwise. Event Registration Addons can register to an event using the hook.events.register(...) function. Similarly, an addon can unregister from an event using the hook.events.unregister(...) function.\nWhen registering to an event, you can write the callback function in multiple formats. The main two formats are considered short-hand and long-hand. Generally, short-hand is the recommended means of writing code as it saves space.\nShort-hand Method 1hook.events.register(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;load_cb\u0026#39;, function () 2 print(\u0026#39;Load event was fired.\u0026#39;); 3end); Long-hand Method 1local function load_callback() 2 print(\u0026#39;Load event was fired.\u0026#39;); 3end 4hook.events.register(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;load_cb\u0026#39;, load_callback); Registering Multiple Callbacks If you need to register to an event multiple times, then you must pass a unique alias for each time you register to the event. For example:\n1hook.events.register(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;load_cb1\u0026#39;, function () 2 print(\u0026#39;Load event was fired.

(2)\u0026#39;); 6end); If you do not pass a unique alias, then the existing registered callback will be overwritten.\nAvailable Events daochook currently exposes the following list of events. Click the name of the event to navigate to its specific information entry.\nEvent Name Event Description load Event raised when the addon is being loaded. unload Event raised when the addon is being unloaded. command Event raised when the game client is handling a command. message Event raised when the game client is about to print a message to the chat/combat windows. packet_recv Event raised when the game client receives a packet. packet_send Event raised when the game client sends a packet. d3d_prereset Event raised when the game client is about to reset the graphics device. d3d_postreset Event raised when the game client has finished resetting the graphics device. d3d_beginscene Event raised when the game client is beginning a new scene. d3d_endscene Event raised when the game client is ending a scene. d3d_present Event raised when the game client is presenting the scene. d3d_renderstate Event raised when the game client is setting a render state. d3d_dip Event raised when the game client is about to render a primitive. d3d_dipup Event raised when the game client is about to render a primitive. d3d_dp Event raised when the game client is about to render a primitive. d3d_dpup Event raised when the game client is about to render a primitive. Event Arguments Information Some of the events that can be raised within an addon have arguments that are passed to their callback functions. These arguments are passed as a single table to help improve performance when calling between the C++ and Lua bounds. This is similar to how C# handles events.\nIf an event has any arguments, you can find more information for those arguments in the information listed below. The argument information tables explain each of the arguments that the given event has access to. They also mark if the argument is read-only or not. When an argument is read-only, it cannot be modified or the addon will throw an error. Any argument not marked as read-only can be modified.\nWhen an argument is modified, all addons that will receive the event after yours will see the new modified value. They will also be given the ability to further modify the value if they see fit. Once all addons have handled the event, if it was not blocked, the client will process the data using the modified values as if that was the original data to begin with.\nInjected Events Events that have an e.injected argument can determine if the event came from the actual game client, or if it was injected by daochook or another addon.\nIt is best practice to not block or modify injected data as another addon has deemed it important enough to be injected. You can increase performance if you exit an event callback early if the event was injected and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to process it.\nBlocked Events Events that have an e.blocked argument can determine if the event has been blocked by daochook or another addon. Once an event has been blocked, it cannot be unblocked. Setting e.blocked to false will not change any previous true value it was set to. If you wish to block the event from reaching the client in your addon, you can set this to true to cause it to be blocked. ie. e.blocked = true;\nIt is best practice to check if an event is blocked and ignore it if you do not need to further act on it. You can increase performance if you exit an event callback early if the event was already blocked and you have no need to process it.\nEvent: load Event raised when the addon is being loaded.\nClick for more event information.. 1hook.events.registered(\u0026#39;load\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;load_cb\u0026#39;, function () 2end); Argument Name Type Description None. \u0026mdash; \u0026mdash; Event: unload Event raised when the addon is being unloaded.\nClick for more event information.. 1hook.events.registered(\u0026#39;unload\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;unload_cb\u0026#39;, function () 2end); Argument Name Type Description None. \u0026mdash; \u0026mdash; Event: command Event raised when the game client is handling a command.\nClick for more event information.. 1hook.events.registered(\u0026#39;command\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;command_cb\u0026#39;, function (e) 2end); Argument Name Type Description e.mode number [Read Only] The command mode. e.imode number [Read Only] The command input mode. e.command string [Read Only] The command string. e.modified_mode number The modified command mode. e.modified_imode number The modified command input mode. e.modified_command string The modified command string. e.injected boolean [Read Only] Flag that states if the event was injected by daochook or another addon. e.blocked boolean Flag that states if the event has been blocked by daochook or another addon.

Below you can find an overview of the projects main features. Please note, because daochook offers a very in-depth Lua addon interface, the feature-set of the project is endless and ever-expanding by users sharing addons!\nCustom Injector / Launcher daochook ships with its own command line injector/launcher. This allows the project to ensure it is properly launched, injected and ran as expected. The launcher is designed to be easy to use and understand by anyone. The launcher also supports two forms of injecting into the game client.\nBy injecting into a new process. (Launched by the injector itself.) By injecting into an existing process. You may use another injector/launcher if you wish, however that launcher must properly invoke daochook\u0026rsquo;s installation export function. If you are working on a custom injector for daochook and need help with this, please contact atom0s on the Discord server.\nClick to read more... The included injector also allows for quick login access using any version of the client that supports it.\n1// General Usage - (Create a new game process and inject..) 2daochook.exe \u0026lt;config_name.ini\u0026gt; 3 4// Advanced Usage - (Inject into an existing game process..) 5daochook.exe \u0026lt;config_name.ini\u0026gt; [process_id] 6 7// Examples 8daochook.exe atom0s.ini 9daochook.exe atom0s.ini 1234 Injected Hook daochook operates by being directly injected into the game client (game.dll) process. This gives the project several advantages over standard external third-party tools. By being directly injected, daochook can directly access the games memory, functions, and other data. It can also easily hook and/or patch the game client in various ways. daochook makes use of this by hooking onto several game functions to greatly enhance the client and expose information to addons. (See more information below!)\nHooked Game Functions daochook takes advantage of being injected by hooking onto several major game functions including:\n(Chat) Command Handler - The game function responsible for handling all command input within the client. (Typed, macros, built-in system, menus, etc.) (Chat) Message Handler - The game function responsible for outputting messages to the chat/combat log window(s). (Packets) Incoming Packet Handler - The game function responsible for handling incoming packets from the server. (Packets) Outgoing Packet Handler - The game function responsible for handling outgoing packets from the client. By hooking onto these functions, daochook is able to do multiple things including:\nRead: See any time the function(s) are called and log/view the parameters they were called with. Block: Prevent the game client from ever seeing the call was made. Modify: Alter the parameters to change how the call will actually be invoked by the game client. Inject: Manually invoke the original function to easily inject custom data. Click to read more... For example, let\u0026rsquo;s look closer at the (Chat) Command Handler function. This function is responsible for handling all command input within the client. This function is called whenever the user types something into chat, uses a slash command (ie. /wave), presses a macro, clicks a button that will cause a command to be parsed/interpreted, etc.\nThe function looks like this:\n1void handle_cmd(const char* command, int32_t mode) 2{ 3 // ... 4} The game client also has a secondary input mode pointer that is used with command input that is not passed as a normal argument, it is instead a global variable.\nAny time a command is to be handled by the client it will pass through this function. Once hooked, daochook has the ability to fully take control of the function call. Each time the function is called, daochook will first attempt to \u0026lsquo;handle\u0026rsquo; it. This means that the command will go through a \u0026lsquo;process\u0026rsquo; chain to see if anything can make use of it before it eventually gets sent to the client to be handled as normal.\nThe order in which things happen looks like this:\nGame calls original command handler function. daochook intercepts the call, forwards it to its own internal handler. daochook checks for any built-in commands it will handle first. (ie. /addon) If daochook handles the command, it is blocked from being seen by the client. If daochook does not handle the command, the chain continues. daochook forwards the command to its internal addon manager. The addon manager sends the command to all loaded addons that have a valid command event handler registered. If an addon handles the command, it is blocked from being seen by the client. If no addon handles the command, the chain continues. If nothing has handled the command, it is sent to the client as normal. During this chain, both daochook and/or an addon have the chance to alter any of the parameters of the original call. For example, if the command being handled is /wave and instead you want to do /shrug, you can easily do this with an addon.\nThis can also be used to modify incoming and outgoing packets, or out-right block packets from being sent or received!\nDirect3D Hook Along with hooking various game functions, daochook also hooks onto the games Direct3D device. This allows the hook to render its own things into the game scene, either in 2D or 3D. The main purpose for this however, is to allow the use of ImGui to render custom in-game UI elements from addons. By hooking the Direct3D interface, it is also possible to alter how the scene renders, helping clean up visibility in various conditions.\nToggling The Game Fog Rendering The games fog can be toggled on and off with a simple slash command.\nAltering The Game Ambient Light Rendering The games ambient lighting can be toggled on and off, and overridden with a custom color allowing you to see easier in the dark or if your system has a hard time displaying darker areas.\nToggling The Z-Buffer Rendering The game z-buffer can be toggled on and off with a simple slash command, making it possible to see through walls. (Note: This does not allow you to target or cast through walls! Collision and obstruction still works as normal.)\nCustom UI via ImGui daochook implements and [fully] exposes ImGui to Lua for addons to make use of. You can easily create your own custom UI elements that can interact with the game directly, display useful / important game information, and much much more!\nYou can find more information about ImGui here: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui\nAddons, Powered By Lua! daochook includes a powerful custom addon system, backed by Lua. (LuaJIT to be more specific, via MoonJIT)\nAddons are sandboxed/isolated Lua scripts that can be used to greatly enhance the game play experience of the game. Addons can do a wide varity of things and are able to directly communicate with the game client in multiple ways.\nYou can access all of the hooked functions directly to allow your addon to easily inject commands, chat messages, packets and more.\nAddons also have full access to ImGui, allowing you to create your own feature-rich UI\u0026rsquo;s.\nWith the use of LuaJIT, addons also have access to C style structure definitions, casting, and function calling, allowing addons to even further extend their usefulness by directly interacting with game data and functions.\nFor example, here is a simple addon that will handle the command /derp. Anytime this command is used, it will instead use /wave.\n1addon.name = \u0026#39;example\u0026#39;; 2addon.author = \u0026#39;atom0s\u0026#39;; 3addon.desc = \u0026#39;A simple example addon.\u0026#39;; 4addon.link = \u0026#39;https://atom0s.com\u0026#39;; 5addon.version = \u0026#39;1.0\u0026#39;; 6 7require \u0026#39;common\u0026#39;; 8require \u0026#39;daoc\u0026#39;; 9 10hook.events.register(\u0026#39;command\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;command_cb\u0026#39;, function (e) 11 -- Parse the command into arguments.. 12 local args = e.modified_command:args(); 13 14 -- Command: /derp 15 if (#args \u0026gt;= 1 and (args[1]:ieq(\u0026#39;derp\u0026#39;) and e.imode == daoc.chat.input_mode.slash) or args[1]:ieq(\u0026#39;/derp\u0026#39;)) then 16 -- Mark the command as handled, prevents the game from seeing it.. 17 e.blocked = true; 18 19 -- Inject a new command into the handler.. 20 daoc.chat.exec(daoc.chat.command_mode.typed, daoc.chat.input_mode.normal, \u0026#39;/wave\u0026#39;); 21 return; 22 end 23end); For full information on addons, please check the developer documentation section of this site!\nWindow Modifications daochook modifies the game window such that the icon is shown and overridden with the projects own icon. The window title is also automatically updated to your current characters name to make finding the proper game window when multiboxing much easier. It also allows third-party programs to interact with the game windows much easier as you can just use the window name to find the proper process if you are using certain older tools.\nCustom Window Title Override Custom Window Icon Override Overridding the window icon and taskbar icons.. Overridding the ALT+Tab window icon..\nCustom user.dat Override Fix Long time players will know the bug dealing with the user.dat file and all the headaches it can cause. Crashing while multiboxing can lead to tons of undesired downtime due to having to micro-manage numerous accounts after a crash. daochook includes a custom patch/fix for this problem. When enabled, daochook will override the path that the game attempts to look for your user.dat file, making it individual per-account. This means that each account can easily have its own settings without interferring with another client.\nThese custom overrides are stored in: \u0026lt;daochook_path\u0026gt;\\config\\daoc\\\u0026lt;account_name\u0026gt;\\user.dat\nYou can easily copy your existing user.dat file(s) into the proper folders based on your account names or allow the client to create a new one for each account you log into with this setting turned on.\nNo longer do you need to juggle accounts after one crashes to avoid losing all your characters settings!\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/installation/","title":"Download &amp; Install","tags":[],"description":"","content":"daochook is designed to be self-contained and easy to install (and uninstall).\nBefore installing daochook, be sure that your system meets the minimum requirements and that you have all system requirements for the project installed.\nYou can find a full list of requirements here: Click Here\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/usage/","title":"Usage","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This section covers the various methods of using daochook including configurations, in-game commands and more.\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/developers/namespaces/bits/","title":"bits","tags":[],"description":"","content":"This namespace is currently unused.\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/developers/libraries/common/","title":"common","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The common library is a general purpose library used to pull in and require commonly used librarys in a central single file.

The main library file will automatically determine your client version, then include the additional version-specific sub-library files found within the /addons/libs/daoc/ folder. These sub folders are separate into client versions to ensure that the functionality will work on as many clients as possible. It’s also easy to add support for other client versions by simply making a copy of an existing folder and updating the function information and pointers appropriately.\nThis library makes heavy use of LuaJIT\u0026rsquo;s FFI library, which allows Lua to be able to define C-style structures as well as cast to and allocate against C-style functions and memory. This allows Lua to directly call game functions, query for the game structures as they are in memory, etc. Please note that because of how this library works, it is more prone to hard-crashing the client if you are not careful with how you attempt to use things.

"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/developers/","title":"Developers","tags":[],"description":"","content":"daochook allows anyone to further expand on its features through its custom addon system. Addons are powered by Lua (more specifically, LuaJIT via MoonJIT).\nWhat is Lua? Lua is a powerful, fast and lightweight scripting language that can be embedded into nearly any kind of project.\nLua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.\ndaochook makes use of LuaJIT, via the fork called MoonJIT. You can find more information about each of these projects here:\nLua: http://www.lua.org/about.html LuaJIT: https://luajit.org/ MoonJIT: https://github.com/moonjit/moonjit What are addons? Addons are individual isolated/sandboxed instances of a Lua state that loads/runs a given base Lua script. This script will remain loaded until it either is manually unloaded by the player or told to unload otherwise by other means. (ie. If another addon tells it to unload, or it has an error etc.) Addons generally function by registering to predefined events exposed by daochook which allows them to react to various things. An addon can also do something as simple as patching part of the game client when it loads and then nothing else for the duration that it is loaded.\nBecause addons have the potential to throw an error, they are ran in isolated/sandboxed instances of Lua. This means that every loaded addon has its own Lua state. Addons are considered \u0026lsquo;dumb\u0026rsquo; in the sense that they are not aware of another addon being loaded/existing because of this sandboxed setup. If an addon throws an error, instead of causing all addons to stop working, it simply causes only the single addon that errored to stop.\ndaochook exposes a large amount of helpful functions to each addon that implements various things such as:\nAccess to certain game functions. Access to game memory through read/write helpers. Access to additional file IO helpers. Access to additional regex helpers. Access to additional time related helpers. And more! Since daochook is also using LuaJIT, addons have access to its FFI library, which even further greatly expands on the features that addons can make use of. FFI, which stands for foreign function interface, allows you to make use of calling external C functions, using C data structures, and casting direct memory to function definitions / memory structures all from within Lua. This greatly enhances what can be done from an addon.\nHow do addons work? As mentioned above, addons run isolated in their own Lua state. Once an addon is loaded, any time a predefined event occurs within daochook, the event will then be forwarded and raised in all loaded addons that have registered to the given event.\nFor example, an event that daochook exposes is command. This event is raised any time the game client is attempting to process a command that was sent to the games internal command handler. (ie. When typing into the chat box, using a \u0026lsquo;slash\u0026rsquo; command such as /wave, using a macro, etc.)\nWhen the event is raised, it will be passed to daochook\u0026rsquo;s internal addon manager, which then loops through all loaded addons, and raises the event inside each addon that has a valid registered event callback for the event. Addons can register to an event multiple times if needed as well.\nThese events allow addons to react to various aspects of the game.\nAdditional Lua Information Whether you are new to Lua or a seasoned pro, here are some links to help get you started or freshen up on your Lua knowledge.\nLua Project Links Lua Manual 5.1: http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ Lua Manual 5.2: http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/ Lua Manual 5.3: http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/ Note: MoonJIT, which is used within daochook implements LuaJIT with parts of Lua 5.2 and 5.3 added.

Feel free to donate or sponsor me on the following platforms.\nSponsor via GitHub Sponsor via Patreon Donate via PayPal daochook is released completely free of charge.\nDonations and sponsorships are completely optional and are a means to say thanks.\nHow does daochook work? daochook is an injected hook that is directly injected into the DAoC game client (game.dll) while launching the game.\nBecause of how daochook functions, it works entirely separate from the games files and DOES NOT require any additional client modifications! You do not need to modify any of your existing client files in order to use daochook making setup and usage a breeze.\nOnce injected into the game client, daochook then hooks itself onto several game functions allowing it to both take control of said functions, but also allow Lua addons to inject various things into the client as if it was done normally by the player.\nFor example, daochook hooks onto the games chat input where you would normally enter a command such as /wave to wave at someone. daochook intercepts all commands that run through the games command interpreter/handler and forwards them to its custom Lua addon engine. Addons can then decide if the command should be blocked from executing, allowing an addon to react to it first. This setup allows addons to implement and react to custom commands that are otherwise not built into the game client.\nAlong with this, by hooking the command handler function, Lua addons can also inject commands as if the player typed them, used a macro, or any other means of input the client would normally recognize.\nThis approach is applied for several major game functions allowing daochook to greatly enhance the features of the client.\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/developers/libraries/json/","title":"json","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The json library is simply a third-party library implementing the JSON file format.

Libraries are generally pre-packaged and found within the /addons/libs/ folder.\nAddon developers are free to make their own libraries. Libraries do not need to be placed in the libs folder in order to operate. If you have a library that you have made and feel would useful to all developers, feel free to contact daochook staff to see about having your library added to the main release package.\nLibraries are easy to use by any addon. Simply require them into your addon script(s). For example, most addons will want to make use of the common library. This lib will include a handful of common libraries for you. This can be included like:\n1require \u0026#39;common\u0026#39;; Libraries that are contained within subfolders can be included by passing the full path to the lib file, replacing any slash character in the path with a period instead. For example:\n1require \u0026#39;sugar.nil\u0026#39;; Compiled Libraries Compiled libraries, or clibs, are DLLs that expose functionality through a compiled C/C++ DLL file. Lua has a special setup to allow DLLs to be used as libraries when calling require. A compiled library must export a luaopen_ function that contains the name of the file as the require name that will be used. For example, if you have a clib named hello.dll then you would require it as:\n1require \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;; Using this setup, hello.dll must export a function named luaopen_hello.\nThe library can also expose multiple luaopen_ functions that are used for specific namespace tables of functions. For example, the library may export multiple functions like this:\nluaopen_hello_earth luaopen_hello_world Then a script would require them as:\n1require \u0026#39;hello.earth\u0026#39;; 2require \u0026#39;hello.world\u0026#39;; For more information on compiled libraries, please check Lua\u0026rsquo;s documentation here: https://www.lua.org/pil/26.2.html\nIncluded Libraries daochook comes with the following included libraries:\nClick the library file name to open more information specific to that library.\nLibrary File Name Usage Description common.lua require 'common'; Library that includes the various other commonly used lib files.

Event Usage The settings library makes use of a custom event setup (similar to normal addon events) that is used to inform an addon of when a settings table is changed. (Via loading, reload, or resetting.) Addons can register to a specific settings table for this event to ensure their current settings are up to date with what the library has currently loaded and cached.\nThe registration to the given event looks like this:\n1settings.register(\u0026#39;settings\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;settings_update\u0026#39;, function (e) 2 3end); Note: The alias given here, settings is the default alias when a unique one is not given. If you are using a specific alias for your settings, then you should change this string to match!\nWhen this event is invoked, e will contain the updated settings table that your addon should make use of. It is also ideal for your addon to make any adjustments, update its various properties/UI/etc. and such in relation to these new settings to ensure what is curerntly being shown/used is properly up to date. Afterward, it is suggested that you also save the settings after to ensure your settings and the library match on disk.\nHere is an example of all of this:\n1-- Include the needed libraries.. 2require \u0026#39;common\u0026#39;; 3local settings = require \u0026#39;settings\u0026#39;; 4 5-- Define your addons default settings.. 6local default_settings = T{ 7 value1 = 1234, 8 value2 = true, 9 value3 = \u0026#39;Hello world.\u0026#39;, 10}; 11 12-- Load the addon settings.. 13local cfg = settings.load(default_settings); 14 15-- Register to the settings update event.. 16settings.register(\u0026#39;settings\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;settings_update\u0026#39;, function (e) 17 -- Update the settings table.. 18 cfg = e; 19 20 --[[ 21 Do additional updates to your addons properties here. 22 --]] 23 24 -- Ensure settings are saved to disk when changed.. 25 settings.save(); 26end); You should not edit your default_settings table ever when defining it as the defauls/outline of what you expect for your addons settings.

This is considered dangerous because of what this will do to the default functionality of Lua.\nLua, by default, will raise an error if you attempt to call or index a nil value. This is good practice to avoid unintended situations in code and should generally ALWAYS be followed. This sub-library will remove those restrictions of Lua and allow you to attempt to call a nil function, inde a nil object/value, etc.\nThis SHOULD NOT be used to avoid proper error handling. This SHOULD NOT be used to avoid fixing problems with code. Please DO NOT use this sub-library unless you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing!\nIf you do wish to use this feature, then you will need to adjust how you include the common library to call the enabler function for it:\n1local common = require \u0026#39;common\u0026#39;; 2 3common.sugar.enable_nil_sugar(); -- Enables the nil metatable override.. 4common.sugar.disable_nil_sugar(); -- Disables the nil metatable override.. string Implements various helper functions that extend the default string. global table.\nThis sub-library also overrides the default string type metatable to expose these new functions directly onto string type values.\ntable Implements various helper functions that extend the default table. global table.\nBecause of how Lua functions, it is not possible to fully override the table type metatable and have additional functionality applied to any table type. To get around this, sugar implements its own table initialization call. This wraps the given table with an enhanced metatable giving access to call all table functions directly on the type. You can use this function to either create a new or \u0026lsquo;upgrade\u0026rsquo; an existing table.\n1-- Normal Lua Table.. 2local t1 = { }; 3 4-- Sugar Enhanced Table.. 5local t2 = T{ }; 6 7-- Sugar Enhanced Table Upgrade.. 8local t3 = T(t1); When you create a sugar enhanced table, this enables all of sugar\u0026rsquo;s features that are extending the metatable of the table object.\nHere is an example:\n1-- Normal Lua table usage example.. 2local t = { }; 3table.insert(t, 2); 4table.insert(t, 3); 5table.insert(t, 1); 6table.sort(t); 7 8for k, v in pairs (t) do print(v); end 9 10-- Sugar enhanced table usage example.. 11local t = T{ }; 12t:insert(2); 13t:insert(3); 14t:insert(1); 15t:sort(); 16t:each(function (v) print(v); end); Sugar is very powerful in how much it can allow you to transform normal Lua code into a functional programming syntax.\n"},{"uri":"https://daochook.github.io/developers/libraries/switch/","title":"switch","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The switch library is a simple library used to create a C/C++ like switch case statement in Lua.\nLua does not have a stock method of implementing switch statements, thus this library can make that a possibility.\nThe switch library is based on code by Ryan Hartlage. https://github.com/ryanplusplus/switch.lua\nUsing The Library Addons should require the common library if they wish to use the switch library.

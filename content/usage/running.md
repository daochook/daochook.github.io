### Launching daochook

**daochook** can be launched two different ways. Either by creating a new instance of the game client and injecting into it, or by injecting into an existing game client process. _It is recommended that you use **daochook** by injecting into a new client instance (which the injector will launch for you) for best results._

When the injector starts, it will take the given file name and locate it within the boot configuration directory automatically.\
The path to the **daochook** boot configuration directory is: `<Path To daochook>\config\boot\`

_Be sure to read the [configurations documentation](/usage/configurations/) page for more information on how to configure **daochook**._

#### New Process Injection

You can launch and inject into a new process via the injector like so:

```
daochook.exe atom0s.ini
```

#### Existing Process Injection

You can inject into an existing process by passing the existing process id as a second parameter to the injector like so:

```
daochook.exe atom0s.ini 1234
```

### Playing On Private Servers

**daochook** is developed and designed mainly for private server usage. It is very easy to adjust your configuration file to work with private servers that run using DOL.

Inside of your configuration file, the main setting you need to set is:

```ini
[daochook.patches]
disable_encryption = 1
```

_This will patch out the encryption of the client which DOL requires to be disabled._

### Playing On Retail Servers

**daochook** is developed and designed mainly for private server usage, however, it should work fine on retail servers as well.

Inside of your configuration file, the main setting you need to set is:

```ini
[daochook.patches]
disable_encryption = 0
```

You should then properly fill out the server information you are trying to log into in order to properly connect to the retail servers using **daochook**'s injector.

### Launching daochook

**daochook** expects a boot configuration file to be passed to its launcher when running, such as:

```
daochook.exe atom0s.ini
```

When the launcher starts, it will take the given file name and locate it within the boot configuration directory automatically.\
The path to the **daochook** boot configuration directory is: `<Path To daochook>\config\boot\`

_Be sure to read the [configurations documentation](/usage/configurations/) page for more information on how to configure **daochook**._

The `socket` library is part of the `LuaSocket` library. It implements the base functionality for usages of sockets.

Because **daochook** does not make this library, the documentation here will instead link to its official page.

You can find more information about the full `LuaSocket` library here: https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasocket

_The additional socket types and other libs used with this library are found within the `socket` subfolder._

The `mime` library is part of the `LuaSocket` library. It implements MIME file information and support more specifically used with sockets.

Because **daochook** does not make this library, the documentation here will instead link to its official page.

You can find more information about the full `LuaSocket` library here: https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasocket

title: "json"

The `json` library is simply a third-party library implementing the JSON file format. This library is created by `rxi`.

Because **daochook** does not make this library, the documentation here will instead link to its official page.

You can find more information about this library here: https://github.com/rxi/json.lua

_**Note:** This library is not recommended to be used for general purpose addon configurations._\
_Instead, you should make use of **daochook**'s `settings` library if you need addon configurations._\
_This library should only be used if you absolutely need support for JSON files._

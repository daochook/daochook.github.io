**daochook** includes a handful of various helper functions that are exposed to each addons Lua state. These functions are separated into namespaces that make it cleaner and easier to read when being accessed. Below is a table of each of the namespaces that are exposed from **daochook**.

_**Note:** This page does not include the additional functions created by or added to the given namespaces via the included addon `libs`. Those have their own documentation pages._

_Click the namespace name to go to that namespaces individual documentation page._

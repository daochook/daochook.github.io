Either by creating a new instance of the game client and injecting into it, or by injecting into an existing game client process. It is recommended that you use daochook by injecting into a new client instance (which the injector will launch for you) for best results.
When the injector starts, it will take the given file name and locate it within the boot configuration directory automatically.</description></item><item><title>In-Game Commands</title><link>https://daochook.github.io/usage/commands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daochook.github.io/usage/commands/</guid><description>daochook includes several custom commands that are built-in, which you can access by typing into the game chat like a normal slash command.

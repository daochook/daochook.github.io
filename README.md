## Documentation Requirements

In order to work on the documentation, you must have `hugo` installed.

You can find more information on how to install `hugo` here:
[Click Here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

## Building Documentation Locally

Once you have `hugo` installed, you can build and view the documentation offline / locally by running `hugo` via:

```
cd /path/to/documentation
hugo server
```

Once `hugo` is running it will display a url you can visit to view the documentation locally. `hugo` will also live update any changes you make to the documentation. _(In some cases, you may need to terminate `hugo` and run it again for full changes to take affect.)_

## Documentation Theme

The documentation is using a theme called `learn`. However, the official release of this theme is outdated, thus a fork has been made to keep the third-party dependencies up to date manually. You can find our fork of the theme here: https://github.com/daochook/hugo-theme-learn

Any design changes that you wish to contribute should be done as an override in this repository. _Do not make theme edits/changes to the actual theme repo linked above!_

## Published Documentation Notes

The repository is setup with a custom GitHub workflow that will automatically rebuild the documentation and publish it. This workflow automatically creates and pushes the built website to the `gh-pages` branch within this repo. Please **DO NOT** edit the workflow file and **DO NOT** edit or commit anything to the `gh-pages` branch. This branch is automatically overwritten each time the website is rebuilt, so your changes will be lost!
